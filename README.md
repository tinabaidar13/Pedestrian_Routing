# Pedestrian_Routing
This is the repository to store the work that has been done for the Evaluating routing-algorithm approaches for pedestrian behavior simulation course, 2019, Master in Geospatial Technologies  in the University of Muenster.

Hausdorff Distance metric is used to calculate the difference between computed and observed routes. Implementation of code requires installation of scipy.
